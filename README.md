		- database storage (sql, redis or smth else + Entity Framework?)
		- show errors on front-end
		- allow to user input on user creation (for now it's hardcode)
		- remove start project files (mostly js)
		- organize project files

		- do Docker file for run in Docker
		- add credentials (in bottom or another page)
		- tests (for practice)
